Creation Patterns
	- Deal with the creation (construction of objects)
	- Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc)
	- Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (Step-by-step)

Structural Patterns
	- Concerned with the structure (e.g, class members)
	- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface
	- Stress the importance of good API Design

Behavioral Patterns
	- All different without a central theme
